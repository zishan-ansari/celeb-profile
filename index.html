                <img class="hero-img" src="images2.jpg"/>
                <h2>Salman Khan’s run-in with the law</h2>
                <p>Salman Khan ran into trouble with the law in 1998 when the actor was booked in four cases regarding 
                  poaching of blackbuck and chinkara. The actor was shooting for ‘Hum Saath Saath Hain’ when the star cast,
                   including Sonali Bendre and Saif Ali Khan, took a break from the shooting near Jodhpur to allegedly go 
                   hunting. Salman was accused of poaching of two endangered black bucks in village Kankani in Jodhpur 
                   on 1-2 October, 1998.</p>

                   <p>Besides this, two separate cases were registered against him under the Wildlife Protection Act for
                      allegedly poaching three chinkaras in separate incidents on September 26 and September 28, 1998.
                       In the three poaching cases registered against him, the ‘Prem Ratan Dhan Payo’
                      star even served time twice in the Jodhpur Jail ‘ in April 2006 and in August 2007.</p>

                      <p>He was also charged under the Arms Act for possessing illegal arms. However, Salman was acquitted of 
                        all charges in the Arms Act case against him in the alleged poaching of two black bucks by the 
                        Jodhpur Court on January 18, 2017.</p>

                        <h2>Salman Khan’s turbulent love life with Aishwarya Rai Bachchan</h2>
                    <p>Salman Khan and Aishwarya Rai’s alleged relationship was quite turbulent. According to reports,
                           the actor had kept banging the door of Aishwarya’s house one night in November 2001. The drama 
                           reportedly continued till 3 am, until the actress relented and let him in. Salman was also accused
                            of creating a ruckus when his relationship with Aishwarya went sour.</p>

                            <h2>Salman Khan’s 2002 hit-and-run case</h2>
                            <p>Salman Khan was far from getting any permanent relief in the blackbuck poaching and chinkara cases
                               when he found himself embroiled in a hit-and-run case in 2002. The actor was accused in the hit-and-run 
                               case when his car reportedly ran into a bakery in Mumbai, killing one and injuring four. 
                               In December 2015, the Bombay High Court acquitted Salman of all criminal charges in a hit-and-run case,
                                just months after he’d been found guilty by a trial court.
